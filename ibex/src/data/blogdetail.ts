      <h2>Introduction to Web Development</h2>
      <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It involves different aspects like web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. The field has grown exponentially over the past decades, with the internet becoming an integral part of our daily lives.</p>
      
      <p>If you're interested in becoming a web developer, you're embarking on an exciting journey. The web development landscape offers countless opportunities for creativity, problem-solving, and innovation. Plus, it's a field with consistently high demand and competitive salaries.</p>
      
      <h2>The Three Pillars of Web Development</h2>
      
      <h3>HTML: The Structure</h3>
      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the structure and content of web pages. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a website.</p>
      
      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my first web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h3>CSS: The Presentation</h3>
      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation, formatting, and layout of web pages. It determines how HTML elements are displayed on screen, on paper, or in other media. CSS is like the skin and clothes of a website.</p>
      
      <pre><code>body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
    text-align: center;
}

p {
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #666;
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>JavaScript: The Behavior</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web pages. It's used to create dynamic and interactive experiences for the user. JavaScript is like the muscles and brain of a website, allowing it to respond to user actions.</p>
      
      <pre><code>document.querySelector('h1').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Hello, World!');
});

function changeColor() {
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = '#' + Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16);
}</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Setting Up Your Development Environment</h2>
      <p>To start coding, you need a few essential tools:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Text Editor or IDE:</strong> Programs like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom are great for writing code.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Browser:</strong> Modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge have powerful developer tools built-in.</li>
        <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git is the industry standard for tracking changes in your code.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Your First Project</h2>
      <p>Let's create a simple profile page using HTML and CSS:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Create a new folder for your project</li>
        <li>Inside that folder, create two files: index.html and styles.css</li>
        <li>Write your HTML code in index.html</li>
        <li>Write your CSS code in styles.css</li>
        <li>Link the CSS file in your HTML using the &lt;link&gt; tag</li>
        <li>Open index.html in your browser to see your webpage</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Congratulations! You've created your first web page. This is just the beginning of your web development journey. As you continue learning, you'll discover how to build more complex websites, implement responsive design, work with databases, and much more.</p>
      
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>Here are some resources to continue your learning journey:</p>
      
      <ul>

    content: `
      <h2>Introduction to Modern CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS has evolved significantly in recent years, with powerful new features that make it easier than ever to create responsive, dynamic user interfaces. This article explores modern CSS techniques that every developer should know.</p>
      
      <h2>Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layout</h2>
      <p>Flexbox is a layout mode designed for one-dimensional layouts - either as a row or as a column. This makes it perfect for constructing navigation bars, form elements, and other UI components.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
      <p>Flexbox introduces several important concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Main Axis and Cross Axis:</strong> Understanding these axes is crucial for controlling flex layout</li>
        <li><strong>Flex Container and Flex Items:</strong> The parent container and its direct children</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> How items grow or shrink relative to each other</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Basic Flexbox Example</h3>
      <pre><code>.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

.item {
  flex: 1;
  margin: 10px;
}</code></pre>
      
      <h2>CSS Grid: Two-Dimensional Layout</h2>
      <p>While Flexbox is great for one-dimensional layouts, CSS Grid excels at two-dimensional layouts, making it ideal for overall page structure and complex UI components.</p>
      
      <h3>Grid Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grid Container and Grid Items:</strong> Similar to Flexbox's container and items</li>
        <li><strong>Grid Lines, Tracks, Cells, and Areas:</strong> These form the foundation of Grid's layout power</li>
        <li><strong>Explicit vs. Implicit Grids:</strong> Understanding how Grid handles defined and undefined content</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Basic Grid Example</h3>
      <pre><code>.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 20px;
}

.header {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
}

.sidebar {
  grid-row: 2 / 4;
}</code></pre>
      
      <h2>CSS Custom Properties (Variables)</h2>
      <p>CSS Custom Properties, often called CSS Variables, allow you to define reusable values that can be referenced throughout your stylesheet. This makes your CSS more maintainable and dynamic.</p>
      
      <h3>Basic Usage</h3>
      <pre><code>:root {
  --primary-color: #3498db;
  --secondary-color: #2ecc71;
  --padding-standard: 1rem;
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  padding: var(--padding-standard);
}

.button-secondary {
  background-color: var(--secondary-color);
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Dynamic Values with JavaScript</h3>
      <p>One of the most powerful aspects of CSS Custom Properties is that they can be modified with JavaScript:</p>
      
      <pre><code>// Change the primary color
document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--primary-color', '#e74c3c');</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Media Queries and Container Queries</h2>
      
      <h3>Media Queries</h3>
      <p>Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles based on device characteristics, such as screen width, height, or orientation.</p>
      
      <pre><code>/* Styles for screens wider than 768px */
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 2rem;
  }
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Container Queries</h3>
      <p>Container queries are a newer feature that allow styles to be applied based on the size of a parent container, rather than the viewport. This makes components more reusable across different contexts.</p>
      
      <pre><code>.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
  }
}</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Modern Responsive Techniques</h2>
      
      <h3>Fluid Typography</h3>
      <p>Create typography that scales smoothly between screen sizes using the clamp() function:</p>
      
      <pre><code>h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 3rem);
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Aspect Ratio Control</h3>
      <p>Maintain consistent aspect ratios for images and videos:</p>
      
      <pre><code>.video-container {
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
  width: 100%;
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Content-Aware Layouts with min(), max(), and clamp()</h3>
      <p>These functions allow for more dynamic, content-aware layouts:</p>
      
      <pre><code>.container {
  width: min(90%, 1200px);
  padding: clamp(1rem, 5%, 3rem);
}</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Animation and Transitions</h2>
      <p>Modern CSS provides powerful tools for creating smooth animations and transitions:</p>
      
      <h3>Transitions</h3>
      <pre><code>.button {
  background-color: blue;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: darkblue;
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Keyframe Animations</h3>
      <pre><code>@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}

.element {
  animation: fadeIn 1s ease-in-out;
}</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Practical Tips for Responsive Design</h2>
      
      <h3>Mobile-First Approach</h3>
      <p>Start designing for mobile devices first, then progressively enhance for larger screens. This ensures your core experience works well on all devices.</p>
      
      <h3>Use Relative Units</h3>
      <p>Prefer em, rem, %, vw, and vh over absolute pixels for better responsiveness.</p>
      
      <h3>Test Across Devices</h3>
      <p>Always test your designs across multiple devices and browsers to ensure consistency.</p>
      
      <h3>Accessibility Considerations</h3>
      <p>Ensure your designs are accessible to all users, including those using screen readers or keyboard navigation.</p>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Modern CSS provides a powerful toolkit for building responsive, flexible user interfaces. By leveraging Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties, and other modern features, you can create designs that adapt beautifully to any device or screen size.</p>
      
      <p>The best way to master these techniques is through practice. Start by rebuilding some of your existing UIs using these modern approaches, and you'll quickly see how they can simplify your code while creating more robust layouts.</p>
